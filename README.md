# Sorting implementation

## 1. Project Description
- This project describes different types of sorting that are used to sort an array.

## 2. Tech Stack / Language
- Language: Java 
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

## 3. File Structure
- BubbleSort.java
- InsertionSort.java
- MergeSort.java
- QuickSort.java
- SelectionSort.java
- ReadMe.md

## 4. Features
- BubbleSort: Sorts the array by comparing adjacent values.
- InsertionSort: Sorts the array by inserting the value in the needed place. 
- MergeSort: Sorts the array by recursively splitting and merging the array.
- QuickSort: Sorts the array by selecting a pivot and putting it in the correct place.
- SelectionSort: Sorts the array by bringing the smallest value to the front.

## 5. How to Run
- Each class has their respective main which can be run independently.

## 6. Time Complexity
- BubbleSort
    Best: O(n)
    Worst: O(n^2)
- Insertion Sort 
    Best: O(n)
    Worst: O(n^2)
- MergeSort: O(n log n)
- QuickSort: O(n log n) worst O(n^2)
- SelectionSort: O(n^2)
    
## 7. Space Complexity
- BubbleSort: O(1)
- Insertion Sort: O(1)
- MergeSort: O(n)
- QuickSort: 
    Average: O(log n) 
    Worst: O(n)
- SelectionSort: O(1)

## 8. Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to have a comprehensive understanding of what is going on in each algorithm and further the user's understanding of time and space complexity.
